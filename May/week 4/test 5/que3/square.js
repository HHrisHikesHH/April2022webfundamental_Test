// Question 3. Check if for a given length and breadth, is the shape a square or rectangle. (eg: Let's say the length is 10 and breadth is 20, and then check).

let l=10,b=20; //decla. and init.
console.log(`lenth is ${l} and breath is ${b}`);
// let res=l===b?"sqaure":"rectangle"; //using ternary operator.
//console.log(res);
console.log(l===b?"sqaure":"rectangle");//directly displaying without saving.
